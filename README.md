#MultiArduinoServer
Multiple serial device listener for Arduino projects.

Based on the Arduino and Java RXTX Sample Code found at http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Java

Program is designed to be able to be compiled and run from a USB stick on Windows or Linux.

This work has been created at:

Lehrstuhl für Strömungsmechanik,  
Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)


#Interface and Usage
A command line interface can be used to connect with multiple serial devices, also works with any device that sends output to terminal:

* -linux		  
  * Server is running on Linux
* -csv			
  * Write all device outputs to csv file
* -port "port name" "device name"	
  * Specify a port and name for a given device

For example,  a multiple device listener for one Arduino and a separate terminal device can be run using the command

> 				java -jar ArduinoServer.jar -linux -csv -port COM7 labanalysis_arduino -port COM10 terminal

Commands can be sent to a device using "command_devicename.txt"


#Dependencies
* Requires the RXTX Java Library found at http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
